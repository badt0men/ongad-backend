# ongad-backend
Backend API server for one of my projects

Wanted to use Nestjs because it's typescripts... but the "angular-like" pattern is not something 
I want to go through right now so I switched to expressjs.

MongoDB is my goto database, while Postgres would have made alot of sense, 
however, I am not looking to implement too many relations here.
